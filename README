For development, the webserver can run on a host PC.

You'll need to install python-twisted first.

Then clone, build and install the IIO library:

  cd $HOME/projects # Or something similar
  git clone https://github.com/analogdevicesinc/libiio.git
  cd libiio
  cmake .
  make -j 8
  sudo make install

To test if this works, run:

  iio_info -u ip:topic-miamimp-xilinx-xdp-xczu7ev.local

This should output a bunch of sensor information.

Then try this:

  python xdpsensors/iiosensors.py ip:topic-miamimp-xilinx-xdp-xczu7ev.local

If you get the error "ImportError: No module named iio", try this to work around
install path issues with Ubuntu and Python:

  export PYTHONPATH=/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages

Since you're not root, and things aren't quite like in release mode, set the
following environment variables:

  export PYTHONPATH="/usr/lib/python2.7/site-packages:."
  export XDP_ROOT=.
  export XDP_PORT=8080
  export XDP_URI=ip:topic-miamimp-xilinx-xdp-xczu7ev.local

And then run the "twistd" deamon:

  twistd -n -y xdpsensors.tac

If that works, direct your browser to:

  http://localhost:8080/
